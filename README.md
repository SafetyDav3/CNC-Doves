# CNC Dovetail Drawer Generator

This repository contains a Fusion 360 add-in that creates a CNC-friendly drawer box with dovetail joints. The add-in provides options for drawer size, material thicknesses, dovetail settings, handle holes and more.

See `DovetailDrawer/README.md` for installation and usage instructions. The add-in folder must contain both `DovetailDrawer.py` and `DovetailDrawer.manifest`.
